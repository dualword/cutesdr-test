// dataprocess.h: implementation for the CdataProcess class.
//
// This class implements a worker thread that takes raw UDP data packets
// as they are received, converts to Complex data and puts in a FIFO.
// The worker thread then is signaled and removes data from the FIFO and
// calls the DSP processing chain.
//
// History:
//	2013-02-05  Initial creation MSW
